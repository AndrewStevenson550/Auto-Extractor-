# Auto-Extractor
This is a web scrapper project that I made for finding information on things. It can be used for generally anything with the headers feature. 


# Setup
To use this automation tool

* Download the Code
* Open the code in an IDE of your choice
* Change the variables such as h_class, element, url, and file_name to your liking (to what you want them to do)
* Run the code and find your new file with your scrapped info! You may need to run os.getcwd() to find where the file will be.

# Thanks for using!
